You will learn the material if you put in the effort, he isn't out to trick or 'get' you.\n          Jae is very serious about cheating so definitely don't try any of that, look him up on Reddit if you do not believe me.\n          Overall, you cannot avoid the class as a CS major/concentrator so you're going to have to take it anyway.

Jae turns his course into a lifestyle; expect to receive emails 24/7 (and not just from the listservâ€” he emailed us the day after Thanksgiving telling us to get back to AP) and to dedicate hours of your life to his labs, all while resisting the urge to Google your questions. Furthermore, Jae is not approachable whatsoever, and I found him rather arrogant and condescending. Final grades are not curved nicely, and are not indicative of how much you learn. However, to Jae's credit, his TAs are very good, and his teaching is decent. He is incredibly polarizing, as the below reviews show, and some people do like him.\n            I wondered who hurt Jae, but it turns out it was none other than his own experience as an undergraduate at Columbia.

Everything you need to know can be easily found in the lecture notes she posts at the end of each week, so attending lectures is pointless. I think attendance trickled down to 20-30 students after the midterm.\n          I will say that the course felt rushed near the end. Discrete was recently bumped up from 3 credits to 4 credits because the syllabus was revised to add more targeted prep for classes like AI. However, itâ€™s clear that Ansaf was not ready for this change. We went through the first three chapters at a snailâ€™s pace before the midterm, and then Ansaf had to cancel a full weekâ€™s worth of lectures because she got COVID. As a result, the second half of the semester felt strapped for time, and we blitzed through the rest of the material. It got to the point where I donâ€™t feel adequately prepared for classes that require Discrete as a prerequisite even though I got an A in this class.\n          On the TAs: it seemed like most of them were TAing for the first time. Piazza posts took forever to get answered, and it usually took a few weeks for graded work to be returned. I never attended their Friday recitations, but the problems they made were generally harder than the homework or exams. Being able to solve these problems means that you truly understand the material, so be sure to do them if you know youâ€™ll need Discrete in the future.\n          At the end of the day, Iâ€™m not sure if I can recommend Ansafâ€™s version of Discrete. Itâ€™s one of the easiest classes at Columbia and doesnâ€™t require a ton of work, but donâ€™t expect it to sufficiently prepare you for higher-level math or theoretical CS classes.

Setting that aside, I have learned more from this class than I have learned from any other class I have taken at Columbia.

This dynamic added a minimum of 10-hours worth of lectures, all of which were 'fair game' for exams and not reflected on the syllabus. Arguing that people are 'soft' for griping about this added workload is asinine, especially during a pandemic when many students are attending from different time zones. In addition to two lectures a week, recitations are available - I would agree with others that the lectures and recitations were minimal value-adds, if only because the exams are set to a higher difficulty level.\n    The five problem sets were straightforward and the ten pop quizzes were manageable. Reading is on the heavier side (~31 chapters), because of the aforementioned glut of content being crammed into a single semester. The added wrinkle is likely confined to the online environment, but this semester saw the first student in the history of the course finish with a perfect score on the quizzes, the highest mean in the history of the course on the final (which was also ~12 points higher than the midterm mean that was proctored through Proctorio, unlike the final), and an overall mean that was at least 7-points higher than previous semesters and I suspect also a record-breaker... All of which is open to interpretation, but is nonetheless especially frustrating when you have no guidance on the curve and the grades in Canvas aren't accurate. Your best bet is to take it P/D/F and uncover.\n    All in all, regardless of your grade, others are correct to point out that you will learn A LOT in this course. Gulati is a good guy who loves Columbia and a fairly solid lecturer who moves fast but with a low degree of empathy to what seemed to be many students expressing difficulties with the pace and delivery of the course - his occasional stoppage tantrums over a few Zoom cameras turned off in a 300-person class bordered on the absurd. One other thing to keep in mind, this course is a feeder to the b-school concentration and the difficulty level is clearly by design - some of which is definitely overkill and part of the effort to curb grade inflation.\n    Workload:\n    Weekly Readings (2-3 Chapters), 10 Pop Quizzes, 5 Problem Sets, Midterm, Final"], ["created_at", "2022-12-06 03:15:38.804399"], ["updated_at", "2022-12-06 03:15:38.804399"]]

Furthermore, Jae is not approachable whatsoever, and I found him rather arrogant and condescending. Final grades are not curved nicely, and are not indicative of how much you learn.

Everything you need to know can be easily found in the lecture notes she posts at the end of each week, so attending lectures is pointless. I think attendance trickled down to 20-30 students after the midterm.\n          I will say that the course felt rushed near the end. Discrete was recently bumped up from 3 credits to 4 credits because the syllabus was revised to add more targeted prep for classes like AI. However, itâ€™s clear that Ansaf was not ready for this change. We went through the first three chapters at a snailâ€™s pace before the midterm, and then Ansaf had to cancel a full weekâ€™s worth of lectures because she got COVID. As a result, the second half of the semester felt strapped for time, and we blitzed through the rest of the material. It got to the point where I donâ€™t feel adequately prepared for classes that require Discrete as a prerequisite even though I got an A in this class.\n          On the TAs: it seemed like most of them were TAing for the first time. Piazza posts took forever to get answered, and it usually took a few weeks for graded work to be returned. I never attended their Friday recitations, but the problems they made were generally harder than the homework or exams. Being able to solve these problems means that you truly understand the material, so be sure to do them if you know youâ€™ll need Discrete in the future.\n          At the end of the day, Iâ€™m not sure if I can recommend Ansafâ€™s version of Discrete. Itâ€™s one of the easiest classes at Columbia and doesnâ€™t require a ton of work, but donâ€™t expect it to sufficiently prepare you for higher-level math or theoretical CS classes.

This dynamic added a minimum of 10-hours worth of lectures, all of which were 'fair game' for exams and not reflected on the syllabus. Arguing that people are 'soft' for griping about this added workload is asinine, especially during a pandemic when many students are attending from different time zones. In addition to two lectures a week, recitations are available - I would agree with others that the lectures and recitations were minimal value-adds, if only because the exams are set to a higher difficulty level.\n    The five problem sets were straightforward and the ten pop quizzes were manageable. Reading is on the heavier side (~31 chapters), because of the aforementioned glut of content being crammed into a single semester. The added wrinkle is likely confined to the online environment, but this semester saw the first student in the history of the course finish with a perfect score on the quizzes, the highest mean in the history of the course on the final (which was also ~12 points higher than the midterm mean that was proctored through Proctorio, unlike the final), and an overall mean that was at least 7-points higher than previous semesters and I suspect also a record-breaker... All of which is open to interpretation, but is nonetheless especially frustrating when you have no guidance on the curve and the grades in Canvas aren't accurate. Your best bet is to take it P/D/F and uncover.\n    All in all, regardless of your grade, others are correct to point out that you will learn A LOT in this course. Gulati is a good guy who loves Columbia and a fairly solid lecturer who moves fast but with a low degree of empathy to what seemed to be many students expressing difficulties with the pace and delivery of the course - his occasional stoppage tantrums over a few Zoom cameras turned off in a 300-person class bordered on the absurd. One other thing to keep in mind, this course is a feeder to the b-school concentration and the difficulty level is clearly by design - some of which is definitely overkill and part of the effort to curb grade inflation.\n    Workload:\n    Weekly Readings (2-3 Chapters), 10 Pop Quizzes, 5 Problem Sets, Midterm, Final"], ["created_at", "2022-12-06 03:21:13.046828"], ["updated_at", "2022-12-06 03:21:13.046828"]]

Everything you need to know can be easily found in the lecture notes she posts at the end of each week, so attending lectures is pointless. I think attendance trickled down to 20-30 students after the midterm.\n          I will say that the course felt rushed near the end. Discrete was recently bumped up from 3 credits to 4 credits because the syllabus was revised to add more targeted prep for classes like AI. However, itâ€™s clear that Ansaf was not ready for this change. We went through the first three chapters at a snailâ€™s pace before the midterm, and then Ansaf had to cancel a full weekâ€™s worth of lectures because she got COVID. As a result, the second half of the semester felt strapped for time, and we blitzed through the rest of the material. It got to the point where I donâ€™t feel adequately prepared for classes that require Discrete as a prerequisite even though I got an A in this class.\n          On the TAs: it seemed like most of them were TAing for the first time. Piazza posts took forever to get answered, and it usually took a few weeks for graded work to be returned. I never attended their Friday recitations, but the problems they made were generally harder than the homework or exams. Being able to solve these problems means that you truly understand the material, so be sure to do them if you know youâ€™ll need Discrete in the future.\n          At the end of the day, Iâ€™m not sure if I can recommend Ansafâ€™s version of Discrete. Itâ€™s one of the easiest classes at Columbia and doesnâ€™t require a ton of work, but donâ€™t expect it to sufficiently prepare you for higher-level math or theoretical CS classes.

This dynamic added a minimum of 10-hours worth of lectures, all of which were 'fair game' for exams and not reflected on the syllabus. Arguing that people are 'soft' for griping about this added workload is asinine, especially during a pandemic when many students are attending from different time zones. In addition to two lectures a week, recitations are available - I would agree with others that the lectures and recitations were minimal value-adds, if only because the exams are set to a higher difficulty level.\n    The five problem sets were straightforward and the ten pop quizzes were manageable. Reading is on the heavier side (~31 chapters), because of the aforementioned glut of content being crammed into a single semester. The added wrinkle is likely confined to the online environment, but this semester saw the first student in the history of the course finish with a perfect score on the quizzes, the highest mean in the history of the course on the final (which was also ~12 points higher than the midterm mean that was proctored through Proctorio, unlike the final), and an overall mean that was at least 7-points higher than previous semesters and I suspect also a record-breaker... All of which is open to interpretation, but is nonetheless especially frustrating when you have no guidance on the curve and the grades in Canvas aren't accurate. Your best bet is to take it P/D/F and uncover.\n    All in all, regardless of your grade, others are correct to point out that you will learn A LOT in this course. Gulati is a good guy who loves Columbia and a fairly solid lecturer who moves fast but with a low degree of empathy to what seemed to be many students expressing difficulties with the pace and delivery of the course - his occasional stoppage tantrums over a few Zoom cameras turned off in a 300-person class bordered on the absurd. One other thing to keep in mind, this course is a feeder to the b-school concentration and the difficulty level is clearly by design - some of which is definitely overkill and part of the effort to curb grade inflation.\n    Workload:\n    Weekly Readings (2-3 Chapters), 10 Pop Quizzes, 5 Problem Sets, Midterm, Final"], ["created_at", "2022-12-06 03:41:15.746739"], ["updated_at", "2022-12-06 03:41:15.746739"]]

I think attendance trickled down to 20-30 students after the midterm.\n          I will say that the course felt rushed near the end.

We went through the first three chapters at a snailâ€™s pace before the midterm, and then Ansaf had to cancel a full weekâ€™s worth of lectures because she got COVID. As a result, the second half of the semester felt strapped for time, and we blitzed through the rest of the material.

This dynamic added a minimum of 10-hours worth of lectures, all of which were 'fair game' for exams and not reflected on the syllabus. Arguing that people are 'soft' for griping about this added workload is asinine, especially during a pandemic when many students are attending from different time zones. In addition to two lectures a week, recitations are available - I would agree with others that the lectures and recitations were minimal value-adds, if only because the exams are set to a higher difficulty level.\n    The five problem sets were straightforward and the ten pop quizzes were manageable. Reading is on the heavier side (~31 chapters), because of the aforementioned glut of content being crammed into a single semester. The added wrinkle is likely confined to the online environment, but this semester saw the first student in the history of the course finish with a perfect score on the quizzes, the highest mean in the history of the course on the final (which was also ~12 points higher than the midterm mean that was proctored through Proctorio, unlike the final), and an overall mean that was at least 7-points higher than previous semesters and I suspect also a record-breaker... All of which is open to interpretation, but is nonetheless especially frustrating when you have no guidance on the curve and the grades in Canvas aren't accurate. Your best bet is to take it P/D/F and uncover.\n    All in all, regardless of your grade, others are correct to point out that you will learn A LOT in this course. Gulati is a good guy who loves Columbia and a fairly solid lecturer who moves fast but with a low degree of empathy to what seemed to be many students expressing difficulties with the pace and delivery of the course - his occasional stoppage tantrums over a few Zoom cameras turned off in a 300-person class bordered on the absurd. One other thing to keep in mind, this course is a feeder to the b-school concentration and the difficulty level is clearly by design - some of which is definitely overkill and part of the effort to curb grade inflation.\n    Workload:\n    Weekly Readings (2-3 Chapters), 10 Pop Quizzes, 5 Problem Sets, Midterm, Final"], ["created_at", "2022-12-18 01:47:33.475878"], ["updated_at", "2022-12-18 01:47:33.475878"]]

I think attendance trickled down to 20-30 students after the midterm.\n          I will say that the course felt rushed near the end. Discrete was recently bumped up from 3 credits to 4 credits because the syllabus was revised to add more targeted prep for classes like AI. However, itâ€™s clear that Ansaf was not ready for this change. We went through the first three chapters at a snailâ€™s pace before the midterm, and then Ansaf had to cancel a full weekâ€™s worth of lectures because she got COVID. As a result, the second half of the semester felt strapped for time, and we blitzed through the rest of the material.

Piazza posts took forever to get answered, and it usually took a few weeks for graded work to be returned.

Itâ€™s one of the easiest classes at Columbia and doesnâ€™t require a ton of work, but donâ€™t expect it to sufficiently prepare you for higher-level math or theoretical CS classes.
